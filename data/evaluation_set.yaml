- question: "Under what conditions should a financial asset be measured at amortised cost?"
  answer: "A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: (a) the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and (b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding."

- question: "When should an entity derecognise a financial asset?"

- question: "What is the rebuttable presumption regarding significant increase in credit risk for past due payments?"
  answer: "Regardless of the way in which an entity assesses significant increases in credit risk, there is a rebuttable presumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. An entity can rebut this presumption if the entity has reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort, that demonstrates that the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition even though the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due."

- question: "What are the three types of hedging relationships defined in IFRS 9?"
  answer: "There are three types of hedging relationships: (a) fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or a component of any such item, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. (b) cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future interest payments on variable-rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction, and could affect profit or loss. (c) hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation as defined in IAS 21."

  answer: "Despite paragraphs 4.1.1–4.1.4, an entity may, at initial recognition, irrevocably designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases"

That accounting policy shall be applied to all such trade receivables or contract assets but may be applied separately to trade receivables and contract assets. (b) lease receivables that result from transactions that are within the scope of IFRS 16, if the entity chooses as its accounting policy to measure the loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. That accounting policy shall be applied to all lease receivables but may be applied separately to finance and operating lease receivables."

- question: "How are gains and losses recognised in a fair value hedge?"
  answer: "As long as a fair value hedge meets the qualifying criteria in paragraph 6.4.1, the hedging relationship shall be accounted for as follows: (a) the gain or loss on the hedging instrument shall be recognised in profit or loss (or other comprehensive income, if the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5). (b) the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item (if applicable) and be recognised in profit or loss. If the hedged item is a financial asset (or a component thereof) that is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A, the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the hedged item is an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5, those amounts shall remain in other comprehensive income."

- question: "When can a credit exposure be designated at fair value through profit or loss because of a credit derivative?"
  answer: "If an entity uses a credit derivative that is measured at fair value through profit or loss to manage the credit risk of all, or a part of, a financial instrument (credit exposure) it may designate that financial instrument to the extent that it is so managed (ie all or a proportion of it) as measured at fair value through profit or loss if: (a) the name of the credit exposure (for example, the borrower, or the holder of a loan commitment) matches the reference entity of the credit derivative ('name matching'); and (b) the seniority of the financial instrument matches that of the instruments that can be delivered in accordance with the credit derivative."

- question: "What is the objective of a fair value measurement?"
  answer: "the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same—to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (ie an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability)."

  location: "604e1ed5-3e38-548d-a97f-0dac2b0f38e9"

- question: "In which market should the fair value measurement assume the transaction takes place?"
  answer: "A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: (a) in the principal market for the asset or liability; or (b) in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability."
  location: "cc5108d9-0bd4-5b83-96f9-668d42d9288e"

- question: "Should transaction costs be included in the fair value measurement?"
  answer: "The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted for transaction costs . Transaction costs shall be accounted for in accordance with other IFRSs.

  answer: "Highest and best use is determined from the perspective of market participants, even if the entity intends a different use. However, an entity's current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset."
  location: "6bebde02-1ecb-5c47-a9a9-5ff87df4504f"

- question: "What does a fair value measurement of a liability assume?"
  answer: "A fair value measurement assumes that a financial or non-financial liability or an entity's own equity instrument (eg equity interests issued as consideration in a business combination) is transferred to a market participant at the measurement date. The transfer of a liability or an entity's own equity instrument assumes the following: (a) A liability would remain outstanding and the market participant transferee would be required to fulfil the obligation. The liability would not be settled with the counterparty or otherwise extinguished on the measurement date."

- question: "What are the three levels of the fair value hierarchy?"
  answer: "this IFRS establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels (see paragraphs 76–90) the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs ( Level 3 inputs )."

  answer: "An entity shall develop unobservable inputs using the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the entity's own data.
