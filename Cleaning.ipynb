       " '157. The exposure measure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting measure of exposure. To be measured consistently with financial accounts, the following should apply: \\n\\uf0b7 on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are net of specific provisions and valuation adjustments (eg credit valuation adjustments); \\n\\uf0b7 physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not allowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and \\n\\uf0b7 netting of loans and deposits is not allowed. \\n(ii) On-balance sheet items \\n158. Banks should include items using their accounting balance sheet for the purposes of the leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments for Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)54 and derivatives. \\n',\n",
       " '(a) Repurchase agreements and securities finance ',\n",
       " '159. SFT are a form of secured funding and therefore an important source of balance sheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks should calculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying: \\n\\uf0b7 the accounting measure of exposure; and \\n\\uf0b7 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework.55 \\n',\n",
       " '(b) Derivatives ',\n",
       " '160. Derivatives create two types of exposure: an “on-balance sheet” present value reflecting the fair value of the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or negative depending on the performance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure representing the underlying economic interest of the contract. \\n161. Banks should calculate derivatives, including where a bank sells protection using a credit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying: \\n\\uf0b7 the accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure calculated according to the Current Exposure Method as identified in paragraphs 186, 187 and 317 of the Basel II Framework. This ensures that all derivatives are converted in a consistent manner to a “loan equivalent” amount; and \\n\\uf0b7 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework.56 \\n_footnote_54 \\nSecurities Financing Transactions are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the transactions depends on the market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements. \\n_footnote_55 \\nExcepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3. \\n_footnote_56 \\nExcepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3.
